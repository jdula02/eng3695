{{< toc >}}

# Launcher Sign-in
1. Select **Add account** and sign in with the Microsoft account used to purchase the game.

# The  *Minecraft*  Launcher
Welcome to the *Minecraft* Launcher! Here, you can modify game options and customize how you want your game to run.

2. For now, we will simply launch the latest version by selecting **Play**.

3. The game will now download the latest version and launch it! Give it a few minutes or so the first time, and you will soon see the game window appear.

# First-time Configuration
4. Welcome to *Minecraft*! With the first launch of this version, you will have the option to select accessibility settings, like a narrator, subtitles, and in-game chat visibility settings. You can change these settings later, so adjust them as you like, return to the first menu, and hit Continue.

# The Main Menu
The main menu says hello! Here you can select how you want to play, or adjust game settings. 

5. We will just use a Singleplayer world, so select **Singleplayer**. 


# World Creation
6. If you haven’t created any worlds before, you will be put right into the world creator. If you have some existing worlds, just hit **New World**.

7. For the purposes of this guide, we will not be doing anything fancy. Just type in a **World Name**, make sure **Game Mode: Survival** is selected, and click **Create New World**. 

After *Minecraft* generates your starting area, known to the pros as “spawn,” you’re in!
